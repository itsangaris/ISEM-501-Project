				La La Land walked away from the Oscars with six wins — the 11th film to ever do so.
				Damien Chazelle's tribute to the golden age of movie musicals had entered the night with a record-tying 14 Oscar nominations — a benchmark previously held only by 1950's All About Eve and 1997's Titanic. The most the film could've taken home was 13, since two of its songs competed against each other in the best original song category.
				Throughout the evening, the Lionsgate musical won the Oscars for best director, actress, production design, cinematography, score and original song.
